            <h1>What's your Akan Name? </h1>
            <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born
                and
                the
                order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and
                character
                of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order,
                twin
                status, or an ancestor's middle name. This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and
                the
                African diaspora. During the 18thâ€“19th centuries, slaves in the Caribbean from the region that
                is
                modern-day Ghana were referred to as Coromantees.</p>
            <p>Many of the leaders of slave rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo,
                and
                Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina. Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they
                also
                have
                an English or Christian name. Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president
                Kwame
                Nkrumah and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan</p>
